  "episode_narrative": "The Banner Fire started around 0930 PST on July 3 in the Banner, California area, near Route 78 in San Diego County. It quickly spread westward and expanded to 150 acres, threatening the town of Julian. Portions of Route 78 were closed, and mandatory evacuation was ordered for 200 homes; however, the evacuation order was lifted later that evening, as the containment increased. Two homes were destroyed. On July 4, four injuries were reported. On July 6, at 0815 PST, the Banner Fire was 100% contained. However, the road closures still remained in effect through the day, as the firefighting crews continued to monitor the burn areas for potential flare-ups. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.",
